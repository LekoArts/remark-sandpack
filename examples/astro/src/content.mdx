Use [`@lekoarts/remark-sandpack`](https://github.com/LekoArts/remark-sandpack) to more easily author [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs) examples in your MDX. It parses individual code blocks and places them into Sandpack's `files` option. This way you don't have to write the JSX yourself.

Here's a live example:

<Playground template="react">

```js name=App.js active
import { NAME } from './constants.js'

export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello {NAME}</h1>
}
```

```js name=constants.js readOnly
export const NAME = 'World'
```

</Playground>

It was authored like so:

````md
<Playground template="react">

```js name=App.js active
import { NAME } from './constants.js'

export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello {NAME}</h1>
}
```

```js name=constants.js readOnly
export const NAME = 'World'
```

</Playground>
